# M Is For MPU - A Convenience Mod.
## Description:
- Adds blank keybind to `settings.cfg` located in the dV directory in `/AppData/roaming` on Windows on first boot with this mod. 
  ***-You must close the game after that first boot and set your own keybinds for this to do anything!***
- `toggle_mpu`: Allows user to toggle their Mineral Processing Unit on or off with a Keybind, as the name suggests, I recommend `M`.

### Credits:
- Za'krin: For their implementation within ZKY, which is where this is derived from, it's a standalone version of that, but worse cause it doesn't set a default keybind for you.
