SYSTEM_AUTOPILOT_BLI|ERM-420 Autopilot

SYSTEM_AUTOPILOT_BLI_DESC|The ERM-420 autopilot is the latest development from Bootleg Industries' Software Division. Bootleg Software was able to successfully reverse engineer the software running on NDCI and ER-42 autopilot modules. The result is an autopilot system with the performance characteristics of the ER-42 while being armed with the NDCI's integration with standard Heads-Up Display systems allowing for monitoring of the autopilot's tactical assessment.
