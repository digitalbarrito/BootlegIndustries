# Bootleg Industries ERM-420 Autopilot System:

## Bootleg Industries and its newly formed Software Division are proud to present:

### Bootleg Software's ERM-420 Autopilot System! 

The ERM-420 autopilot system is the first development project from Bootleg Software's ringled minds. 

Bootleg Software was able to successfully reverse engineer the software running on NDCI and ER-42 autopilot modules. The result is an autopilot system with the performance characteristics of the ER-42 while being armed with the NDCI's integration with standard Heads-Up Display systems allowing for monitoring of the autopilot's tactical assessment.

**Please note: This Autopilot has the same unlock requirement as the ER-42. If you don't have the ER-42 unlocked, you won't have the ERM-420 unlocked. This was an intentional decision.**
