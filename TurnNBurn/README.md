# Turn N Burn - A Convenience Mod.
## Description:
- Adds blank keybinds to `settings.cfg` located in the dV directory in `/AppData/roaming` on Windows on first boot with this mod. 
  ***-You must close the game after that first boot and set your own keybinds for this to do anything!***
- `autopilot_orient_to_mouse`: Allows autopilot to rotate the ship to point towards where ever your mouse is located on screen.
- `autopilot_flip_heading`: Will flip the ship 180 degrees from the current heading. Perfect for turning the ship around for those 'ole Turn and Burn maneuvers.

### Credits:
- cxcorp: For their original implementation
- Za'krin: For their implementation within ZKY, which is where this is derived from.
