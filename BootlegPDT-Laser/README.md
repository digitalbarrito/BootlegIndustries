# Bootleg PDT-Laser: A CL-200AP Jerry Rig:

## Fellow Ringas, Bootleg Industries present to you: 

### The Bootleg PDT-Laser: 

The finest jerry rigged CL-200APs, straight from the junkyard workbench, and Bootleg Industries' Flagship Product! 
Armed with repurposed and reworked gimbal mounts from the PDT-MWG, the Bootleg PDT-Laser sports a 90 degree gimbal angle allowing for a near 180 degree coverage of the front of your Titan!* 


> "What's all that gimbal good for if you can't if you can't hit 'nothin?!" 

I hear you Earl, and we thought of that. The Bootleg PDT-Laser comes retrofitted with salvaged AI governing units** from the famed NDPT-4205. 
Now when we say "retrofitted with salvaged AI" we mean it, this is a junkyard, you can't have everything fancy. She'll point and shoot when you pull the trigger.



***Skill Not Included.*** 

*Requires the purchase of 2 Bootleg Industries BL-PDT-Lasers. 

**Bootleg Industries LLC LTD INC is not liable for any damages or loss of life or property that may occur using our hardware. All Sales Final. 

Now on a more serious note: 

This mod uses the CL-200AP as a base for what is shown, which is a 90 degree gimbal angle and probably a solid several hundred meter targeting range (It can target things off screen to some degree, so...). It's still a laser and it's still a CL-200AP, so use with caution. It functions much like the PDT-MWG does, but lasers, and requires a fire input (Neptune's Beard... could you imagine if this didn't have a manual trigger...).
